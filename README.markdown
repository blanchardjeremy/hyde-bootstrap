# hyde-bootstrap

**Updated for the newest bootstrap version**

A layout for [Hyde][hyde] using the [Bootstrap][bootstrap] framework.
Current stable version: v0.3

## Demo
This is based loosely on [this Bootstrap example layout][bootstrap_template]. The fluid columns are
disabled though


## Setup
The simplest way to use this layout is to:

### Using a Zip File
  1. Download the [latest zip archive](https://github.com/anandtrex/hyde-bootstrap/zipball/master)
  2. Unzip it
  3. Place the unzipped files wherever you want your new Hyde site to be
  4. From the terminal run `hyde gen` to generate the Bootstrap-based site in it's default state
  5. Poke around on the site by opening mynewsite/deploy/index.html in your browser
 
### Using Git

Run these commands on the terminal: 

```bash
  
  #setup a new virtual environment
  virtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute mynewsite/env
  
  # clone the code into that new enviornment.
  git clone http://github.com/anandtrex/hyde-bootstrap.git mynewsite/env/code
  
  # change your directory into the virtual environment and run the activate command.
  cd mynewsite/env && activate
  
  # install the requirements into the virtual environment.
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
  # change into the code directory and generate the Bootstrap-based site in it's default state
  cd code && hyde gen
  
  # start the dev server and surf to http://localhost:8080
  hyde serve
```
Poke around on the site by opening mynewsite/deploy/index.html in your browser


## Usage
### Built-in Templates

There are a variety of templates that you can subclass using `{% extends "templatename.j2" %} on the top of your article
or post.

  * `base.j2` - Contains the bulk of the layout logic, but not the best for subclassing because it doesn't have any grid attached to it.
  * `columns.j2` - Has a main content area and a sidebar. Based on Bootstrap's [fluid.html][bootstrap_template] example.
  * `topbar.j2` - Adds a top bar to the base layout

### Custom Templates
To make real use of this package, you will need to create your own templates.

You can subclass `topbar.j2` or `base.j2` to cover most use cases. All of the templates that are provided serve as a
starting point and as an examlpe of possible approaches you can use.

### Adding Content
Look at all of the `.html` files in the `content` directory for an example of how to begin adding your own content.

You can also go to a separate, fresh directory and run `hyde create mysamplehydesite` to check out their default layout
and content.

### Adding CSS
To extend the CSS of a given page, use the `{% block css %}{% endblock %}` block. You can do this with a `<style>` block
or a `<link>` to a CSS file.

### Publishing
To publish the site, first edit site.yaml to match your preferred publishing (github, sftp, etc). See the
[Hyde README](https://github.com/hyde/hyde/blob/master/README.rst) for details. Then run:

```bash
hyde publish -c prod.yaml
```

Use prod.yaml makes it easy to switch your `site.config.mode` variable to `"production"` which can enable production-only
elements of your site. In the default hyde-bootstrap setup, analytics is only rendered in production mode.
